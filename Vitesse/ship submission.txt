A short description of the ship
The Vitesse is a competitive racing speeder. It has an aggressive pendulum-style swinging design, with exposed front thruster actuation. Maintenance and repairs are made easy with accessible, no-nonsense hatches. Side ramscoops provide extra cooling while inside of nebulae and upper atmospheres. Minimal safety features. Overall mass is kept low, while still conforming to the official ERL (Endokid Racing League) requirements for all racing craft.
