| Salamander Mk.2a1<br><br>''Heavy Fighter''
| Survivor 500
| ?
| Salamander Mk.2a1 is a massive overhaul from the last design. Armed with eight Auto-cannons and four Rail-cannons, it's more heavily armed than most other ships of its class. In addition, 12 additional rear-thrusters have been added to increase the ship's top speed. Armor has been modified to more closely meet the current combat meta, thus lightening up the ship's overall mass.

| Javelin Mk.2<br><br>''Light Fighter''
| Survivor 500
| ?
| The Javelin Mk.2 is a combat ship, armed with four laser cannons, and highly maneuverable; it’s a great mid-price range combat ship. Using only two small fuel tanks and a single fuel rod, to power its four main triangle thrusters, still grants the ship adequate range for escort missions. It’s equipped with ISAN MONO and has a top speed of, roughly, 140-145 m/s, so you can get where you need to be, fast. I hope you consider checking out the Javelin, Thank You for your time.

| Kyanite M2<br><br>''Snub Fighter''
| splet
| ?
| A Kyanite hull updated and overhauled to keep up with recent developments in material science and refueling technologies, the Kyanite M2 possesses the same modules that its former mark had.<BR>
<BR>
The M2, however, is plated with Aegisium and Kutonium plating, with a Bastium hull keeping everything in place; it features a new fuel-rod hatch, button-accessible from the cockpit, and a resource hose for refueling the craft. It additionally has slightly thicker plating on some vectors, and due to slight weight savings it is also negligibly faster than its predecessor.<BR>
<BR>
The M2, like any other Kyanite hull, may be fitted with either Autocannons or Plasma Throwers with no additional modifications.<BR>
<BR>
The Kyanite M2 will REPLACE the Kyanite Mk1 in the OKI shop.

| Quartzite <br><br>'' Strike Craft''
| splet
| ?
| A complete retrofit of a Kyanite-based two-pronged hull, altered so intensely it counts as a completely separate class of craft. It possesses the same generator unit as a Kyanite M2, however, but boasts both more armaments and an additional battery.<BR>
<BR>
The Quartzite is plated with Aegisium and Kutonium plating with a Bastium-beam hull keeping everything in place. Some of its plates are made from bastium to improve integrity.<BR>
<BR>
It lacks a windshield due to issues regarding the profile; no windows would properly fit it, so instead it bears an open-air cockpit.<BR>
<BR>
It has additionally a large generator maintenance hatch, permitting access to its fuel rod and coolant cells. It is advised to check on the cells after running the generator at full capacity for a prolonged period of time.<BR>
<BR>
Due to enhanced thrusters — two Tris and two Boxes — it is markedly faster than a Kyanite M2 and is fitted with twin autocannons and twin plasma throwers, bound to fire in sync with one another and aligned to the crosshair.
